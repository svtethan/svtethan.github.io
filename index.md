## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 8, Part 2
  
  Using nested loops to create a pattern was very cool. Even if it was in ASCII it was super cool to use for loops to translate patterns. It was super simple and short, but it really shows how simple it can be.

* Lab 10, Part 1

  It was interesting to use the different types of loops. But when you get down to the fundamental understanding it's just a bunch of pathways that give you an end product. In this case it was to end up with 2D vectors. Very cool!

* Lab 12, Part 1

  Using vector as well as Magicks in order to create a new image made of separate gifs was super interesting. I wasn't aware of the capabilities of C++ especially with respect to image and color processing. The formatting for vectors was confusing but made sense.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 4, Part 2
  
  A very simple usage of if statements in conjunction with comparison operators was used to create a surprisingly entertaining High or Low game that can be played with two players! While it is basic in function and doesn't use a random number generator to create an answer key, it is as simple as you can get in terms of labs with a more fun usage behind them! 

* Lab 9, Part 1

  This was the first challenging lab for me, consisting of many vectors of strings to store and read values of a given file with text, that was set to be our dictionary, and compare given files that were filled with popular literature, where some were mispelled. Using this we were able to check if there were any spelling errors, and print them out. While it was challenging to input at first, we were able to get a very useful dictionary check for these text files.
  
* Lab 12, Part 1

  Using vector as well as Magicks in order to create a new image made of 3 separate gifs was super interesting. I wasn't aware of the capabilities of C++, especially with respect to image and color processing. We used vectors of doubles, Magick, and Graphics Magick to create tables, combine the three gifs, and store RGB values to combine them into one very cool-looking image later!

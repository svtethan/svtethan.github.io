## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 6, Part 2

  This was a really cool lab to make a simple game of blackjack. It used if statements and bool statements of initialized value to determine card values. The bool statements and initializing of all the card values took a while, but it worked well.

* Lab 8, Part 2

  This lab was simple, but sweet for finding averages using double and float values. It also was able to store 0, negatives, and could output a decimal value. The use of argument sizing was new to me, but became second nature once I learned the idea of it.

* Lab 9, Part 2

  This lab incorporated testing two strings to represent a valid schedule using the letter e. It was actually kind of fascinating to use if, for, and boolean functions to also compare functions. It was challenging to understand initializing strings for comparison, but eventually I got it.
